# Kaprekars-Constant-Testing

This is a simple program to simulate and apply the algorithm required to achieve the Kaprekars Constant

## What is Kaprekars Constant?

Kaprekar constant, or 6174, is a constant that arises when we take a 4-digit integer, form the largest and smallest numbers from its digits, and then subtract these two numbers. Continuing with this process of forming and subtracting, we will always arrive at the number 6174.
